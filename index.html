        <h2>The Boys</h2>
        <img src="the_boys.jpeg" alt="The Boys">
        <h3>Storyline</h3>
        <p>The Boys is set in a universe in which superpowered people are recognized as 
            heroes by the general public and owned by a powerful corporation, Vought 
            International, which ensures that they are aggressively marketed and monetized. 
            Outside of their heroic personas, most are arrogant and corrupt. The series 
            primarily focuses on two groups: the titular Boys, vigilantes looking to keep 
            the corrupted heroes under control, and the Seven, Vought International's premier 
            superhero team. The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all superpowered 
            people, and the Seven are led by the egotistical and unstable Homelander. As a 
            conflict ensues between the two groups, the series also follows the new members 
            of each team: Hugh "Hughie" Campbell of the Boys, who joins the vigilantes after 
            his girlfriend is killed in a high-speed collision by the Seven's A-Train, and 
            Annie January/Starlight of the Seven, a young and hopeful heroine forced to face 
            the truth about the heroes she admires.

        <h3>Storyline</h3>
        <p>On the same day in October 1989, forty-three infants are inexplicably born to random, 
            unconnected women who showed no signs of pregnancy the day before. Seven are adopted 
            by Sir Reginald Hargreeves, a billionaire industrialist, who creates The Umbrella 
            Academy and prepares his "children" to save the world. But not everything went 
            according to plan. In their teenage years, the family fractured and the team 
            disbanded. Now almost thirty years old, the six surviving members reunite upon the 
            news of Hargreeves' passing. Luther, Diego, Allison, Klaus, Vanya and Number Five 
            work together to solve a mystery surrounding their father's death. But the estranged 
            family once again begins to come apart due to their divergent personalities and 
            abilities, not to mention the imminent threat of a global apocalypse.
